# Simple Interest Rate Calculator App
## Made with PyQt5 and Matplotlib

### Overview
This Interest Rate Calculator is a desktop application developed using PyQt for the user interface and Matplotlib for plotting graphs. The application allows users to calculate the future value of an investment or loan based on various input parameters such as principal amount, interest rate, and time period. Additionally, it provides a visual representation of how the investment or loan grows over time through a dynamic graph.

### Features
